POSTRE: Prediction Of STRuctural variant Effects
<h2>IMPORTANT: POSTRE update in progress</h2>
A new version of POSTRE has been uploaded (January 20, 2023). The new version is very similar with the previous one but some changes and new functionalities have been incorporated. During this week the tutorial videos and documentation will be updated.

<h2 id="ExplanationPOSTRE"> <b>What is POSTRE?</b> </h2>

 <div>
POSTRE is a software developed to <b style='color:#1D3354;'>predict the pathogenic impact of Structural Variants (SVs)</b>. POSTRE aims to identify the genes responsible for the disease together with the pathological mechanism. The software determines the SV associated pathogenic events <b style='color:#1D3354;'>in space and time</b> through performing cell type/tissue specific predictions. POSTRE is able to handle <b style='color:#1D3354;'>long-range (enhancer driven) and coding pathogenic events</b>. Read <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496902v1" target="_blank">POSTRE manuscript</a> for more details.

<h2 id="UsingPOSTRE">How to use POSTRE?</h2>
POSTRE can be used to analyse Single or Multiple SVs.
<br><br>
<h4>Analysing a Single SV</h4>
Watch POSTRE performance with a real patient in the following <a href="https://youtu.be/g1vinL4Xra4" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>. Reproduce it in Full Screen and High Quality (1080p) for optimal visualization. For this patient, with BOFS syndrome carrying an inversion <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982769/" target="_blank">(Laugsch et al., 2019)</a>, POSTRE successfully predicts the loss of TFAP2A expression in neural crest cells through an enhancer disconnection mechanism.

<br><br>

<h4>Analysing Multiple SVs</h4>
The multiple SV submission box allows the sequential analysis of multiple structural variants (results can be downloaded as txt tables). The SVs may come from just one or multiple patients.The SVs information has to be uploaded in a specific format. The file format consists on 1 line and 7 columns per structural variant. Each structural variant must only contain two breakpoints. The information associated with each column is provided below:
      <br><br>
      <i>Note: For the case of structural variants happening strictly in one chromosome (deletions, inversions, duplication) the breakpoint 1 is the one associated with a smaller genomic coordinate, and the breakpoint 2 the one associated with a larger genomic coordinate. For translocations, it does not matter.</i>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Column 1: Chromosome for the breakpoint 1  </li>
      <li>Column 2: Genomic coordinates for the breakpoint 1. When not base pair resolution, provide a comma separated range, e.g. 85092268,85092269.  </li>
      <li>Column 3: Chromosome for the breakpoint 2</li>
      <li>Column 4: Genomic coordinates for the breakpoint 2. When not base pair resolution, provide a comma separated range, e.g. 85092268,85092269.</li>
      <li>Column 5: Structural Variant Type. Current options: Inversion, Translocation, Deletion or Duplication.</li>
      <li>Column 6: Comma separated list of phenotypes associated with the structural variant. Current options are: head_neck, limbs, neurodevelopmental or cardiovascular. For instance: head_neck,neurodevelopmental,cardiovascular.  </li>
      <li>Column 7: Structural variant unique identifier e.g. (Patient1_SV3)</li>
      </ul> 
      
The data must be stored in a plain text file with column values separated by tabulations
<br><br>
An example file can be found <a href="https://github.com/vicsanga/Postre/blob/main/testFiles/ExampleMultipleSubmission.tsv" target="_blank">here</a> (to download it  just: right-click the Raw button at the top of the page, select Save Link Asâ€¦, choose the location on your computer where you want to save the file, and select Save).  Additional test files can also be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/vicsanga/Postre/tree/main/testFiles" target="_blank">testFiles</a> folder.
<br><br>
Briefly, upon the analyses of multiple SVs two main tables are provided. The first one is a table with pathogenicity prediction per SV and associated phenotype/s. The second one is an aggregation of the results per gene, phenotype and pathogenic mechanism (coding, long-range). 
<br><br>
A video to clarify these concepts will be provided shortly.

<h2 id="Installation">How to install and run POSTRE?</h2>

<b>Even though you may not have computational skills, do not be afraid!. POSTRE installation is very easy.</b> On top of that, once POSTRE is installed, running and using it is as simple as any other desktop application. Thanks to its user friendly graphical interface.

POSTRE is built with <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a> framework.
Thus, to run POSTRE you only require R (version >=3.5.0).

<h3>1. Installing R </h3>

To run Postre R version >=3.5.0 is required.

There is plenty of available information in the internet about how to install R depending on the OS (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.). Usually upon R installation people also install R-Studio, which is an integrated development environment to write R code. As a result, most tutorials explain how to install both R and R-Studio. But, to run Postre R-Studio is not necessary.  If you need help for R download, different tutorials are provided here:

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZxSA80lF1I" target="_blank">Windows Youtube Tutorial </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LanBozXJjOk" target="_blank">Mac Youtube Tutorial </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN0UZ43G6GE"target="_blank">Ubuntu Youtube Tutorial </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/setup-r-rstudio/">Web Tutorial for installing R and R-Studio in Windows, Mac or Linux <a/></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="POSTRElatestVersion">2. Running POSTRE Latest Version</h3>     
Once R  is installed, just execute the following instruction in an R console to run POSTRE latest version:
<br><br>

```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicsanga/Postre/main/Postre_wrapper.R")
```

The above instruction installs and loads all the required libraries for POSTRE. If some libraries are missing R may ask for permission to install them, confirm it. The first time that you run POSTRE this action will probably take more time.

If you are not sure about how to do it. You can find me initializing POSTRE from R in the video below!
<br><br>

<br>
      
<h3>Alternative option, POSTRE online </h3>     
POSTRE can also be uploaded to a server (e.g. shinyapps.io), by a user with R installed, and accessed online as a normal web app by other users. 

A detailed explanation on how to do that is provided in <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html" target="_blank">Shiny web page</a>.

Recapitulating, you have to:
<ol>
<li>Install the rsconnect R package</li>
<li>Create an account at shinyapps.io</li>
<li>Use the tokens generated by shinyapps.io to configure your rsconnect package.</li>
<li>Deploy apps with rsconnect::deployApp. Regarding this step, download and uncompress POSTRE Github repository.
POSTRE required information for the upload to shinyapps.io is located in Postre_app folder. Thus, this is the folder that has to bee synchronized with rsconnect. e.g:

```R
rsconnect::deployApp('/pathInYourDeviceTo/Postre/Postre_app/', account = 'nameOfYourAccount')
```
</li>
</ol>    


The advantage of this approach is to provide other users in your organization access to the tool without having R installed. However, the person in charge of uploading POSTRE to the server will have to check for new versions or releases of the tool, and re-upload them to the server when available. Contrarily, if POSTRE is executed from an R terminal, with the source() command given above, in <a href="#POSTRElatestVersion">step 2</a>, the latest version of POSTRE will always be executed. If you want to be notified when new major releases of the tool are available, please, send a mail to postre.radaiglesiaslab@gmail.com to be added to the notifications mail list.
